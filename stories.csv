"Hey, are you ready for the English presentation tomorrow?",0
"Yeah, I think so. I practiced a lot.",0
Me too. I'm still a bit nervous though.,1
"Don't worry, you'll do great. You're good at speaking.",0
"Thanks, that's very kind of you to say.",3
No problem. You're always nice to me.,4
Really? I didn't know you noticed.,3
Of course I noticed. You're very smart and funny.,4
"Wow, thank you. You're making me blush.",3
You're welcome. You're very cute when you blush.,5
"Hey, what are you doing here? This is my spot.",2
Your spot? Since when?,2
Since forever. I always sit here during lunch break.,2
"Well, too bad. I got here first.",2
That's not fair. You can't just take my spot.,2
Watch me. I can do whatever I want.,2
"No, you can't. You have to move.",2
"No, I don't. You have to leave.",2
No way. This is my spot and you know it.,2
Fine. Then we'll share it.,6
"Hey, do you want to go to the movies with me tonight?",4
"Sure, that sounds fun. What movie do you want to see?",0
"I don't know, maybe something romantic?",4
Romantic? Are you trying to ask me out?,3
Maybe. Is that a problem?,4
"No, not at all. I like you too.",5
Really? That's great. I'm so happy.,5
"Me too. So, what time do you want to meet?",0
How about 7 pm? I can pick you up if you want.,4
"Okay, sounds good. I'll see you then.",0
"Hi, I'm your new roommate. Nice to meet you.",0
"Hi, I'm sorry but I think there's been a mistake.",6
A mistake? What do you mean?,6
"Well, I requested a single room, not a shared one.",6
"Oh, really? That's weird. I requested a shared room.",6
"So, what do we do now?",6
I don't know. Maybe we should talk to the manager.,6
"Yeah, maybe. But what if they don't have any other rooms available?",6
Then I guess we'll have to make the best of it.,6
Or the worst of it.,7
"Hey, did you hear the news?",0
What news?,6
The news about the zombie apocalypse.,1
The what?,6
The zombie apocalypse. It's happening right now.,1
Are you kidding me?,6
"No, I'm serious. Look outside the window.",1
Oh my god. You're right. There are zombies everywhere.,1
I know. It's terrifying.,1
What do we do? How do we survive?,1
"Hey, I'm sorry to hear about your breakup.",8
"Thanks, it's okay. I'm over it.",7
Really? You don't sound very convincing.,8
"Well, maybe I'm not. It still hurts, you know.",3
I know. I've been there too.,8
Really? How did you cope?,6
"Well, I did a lot of things. I talked to my friends, I listened to music, I exercised, I read books...",8
Did that help?,6
"Yeah, it did. It helped me to distract myself and to heal.",8
That's good. Maybe I should try that too.,6
Do you want me to help you? I can be your friend.,8
Really? That's very nice of you.,3
Of course. You're not alone in this.,8
Thank you. You're very kind.,3
You're welcome. You're very brave.,8
"Hey, I'm really angry with you.",2
Why? What did I do?,6
You know what you did. You cheated on me.,2
"What? No, I didn't. Who told you that?",6
Don't play dumb with me. I saw the messages on your phone.,2
What messages? Let me see.,6
"No, you don't get to see. You already know what they say.",2
"No, I don't. I swear, I never cheated on you.",6
Stop lying to me. It's over. We're done.,2
"No, please. Don't do this. I love you.",5
"So, do you want to talk about what happened?",8
Not really. It's too painful.,3
I understand. But sometimes it helps to let it out.,8
I don't know. I feel like I don't have anything to say.,7
That's okay. You don't have to say anything. I'm here to listen.,8
Thank you. You're a good listener.,3
You're welcome. You're a good talker.,8
Am I? I don't feel like it.,3
You are. You have a lot of interesting things to say.,8
Thank you. You're very sweet.,3
You're welcome. You're very cute.,4
Really? You think so?,3
"Yeah, I do. You have a beautiful smile.",4
Thank you. You're making me blush.,3
You're welcome. You're very attractive when you blush.,5
"Hey, do you want to go to the movies with me tonight?",4
"Sure, that sounds fun. What movie do you want to see?",0
"I don't know, maybe something romantic?",4
Romantic? Are you trying to ask me out?,3
Maybe. Is that a problem?,4
"No, not at all. I like you too.",5
Really? That's great. I'm so happy.,5
"Me too. So, what time do you want to meet?",0
How about 7 pm? I can pick you up if you want.,4
"Okay, sounds good. I'll see you then.",0
"Hey, I'm here. Where are you?",4
I'm outside the theater. I see you.,0
"Wow, you look amazing.",4
Thank you. You look handsome.,3
Thank you. You're very sweet.,4
You're welcome. You're very charming.,3
"So, what movie did you choose?",0
"Well, I thought we could watch a comedy. Is that okay?",4
"Yeah, that's fine. I love comedies.",0
Me too. They always make me laugh.,0
Great. Let's go then.,4
"Okay, let's go.",0
That was a funny movie.,0
"Yeah, it was hilarious.",0
I especially liked the part where...,0
"Oh, me too. That was so funny.",0
You have a great sense of humor.,4
Thank you. You have a great taste in movies.,3
Thank you. You have a great smile.,5
You're welcome. You have a great kiss.,5
"Hi, I'm your new roommate. Nice to meet you.",0
"Hi, I'm sorry but I think there's been a mistake.",6
A mistake? What do you mean?,6
"Well, I requested a single room, not a shared one.",6
"Oh, really? That's weird. I requested a shared room.",6
"So, what do we do now?",6
I don't know. Maybe we should talk to the manager.,6
"Yeah, maybe. But what if they don't have any other rooms available?",6
Then I guess we'll have to make the best of it.,6
Or the worst of it.,7
"Hey, don't be so pessimistic. Maybe it won't be so bad.",0
Maybe. But I value my privacy and space.,7
I understand. But I'm sure we can get along well.,0
How do you know that? We barely know each other.,7
"Well, let's get to know each other then. What's your name?",0
My name is Alex. What's yours?,7
"My name is Sam. Nice to meet you, Alex.",0
"Nice to meet you too, Sam.",7
"So, what are you studying?",0
I'm studying computer science. What about you?,7
I'm studying psychology. That's cool.,0
Thanks. It's interesting.,7
"Yeah, I bet. Do you have any hobbies?",0
Not really. I just like to read and play games.,7
Me too. What kind of books and games do you like?,0
I like fantasy books and RPG games. You?,7
I like mystery books and puzzle games. We have similar tastes.,0
"Yeah, we do. Maybe we're not so different after all.",7
Maybe not. Maybe we can be friends.,0
Maybe we can. Maybe even more than friends.,4
"Hey, do you want to go to the haunted house with me?",4
"Uh, I don't know. I'm kind of scared of ghosts.",1
"Come on, don't be a chicken. It'll be fun.",4
Fun? How is being scared fun?,6
It's a thrill. It makes you feel alive.,4
Or dead.,1
"Don't worry, it's not real. It's just actors and props.",4
Are you sure?,6
"Yeah, I'm sure. Trust me.",4
"Okay, fine. I'll go with you. But don't leave me alone.",1
"Hey, did you hear the noise?",1
What noise?,6
The noise from the basement.,1
"No, I didn't hear anything.",6
"Shh, listen. There it is again.",1
I still don't hear anything.,6
How can you not hear that? It sounds like someone is banging on the door.,1
Maybe it's just the wind.,6
The wind? In the basement?,6
"Yeah, maybe. Or maybe it's a rat.",6
A rat? That's even worse.,1
"Well, do you want to go check it out?",6
"No, do you?",1
"No, not really.",6
Then let's just ignore it and hope it goes away.,1
"Hey, I'm really sorry about what I said yesterday.",3
What did you say yesterday?,6
You don't remember?,3
"No, I don't. Why? What did you say?",6
"Well, I kind of confessed my feelings for you.",3
You did? How come I don't remember that?,6
Because you were drunk.,3
I was drunk? When?,6
At the party. Don't you remember anything?,3
"No, not really. I only remember having a few drinks and then waking up with a headache.",6
"Oh. Well, that explains it.",3
"So, what did you say exactly?",6
I said that I liked you more than a friend and that I wanted to be with you.,3
Wow. And what did I say?,6
You said that you liked me too and that you wanted to kiss me.,3
I did? Did we kiss?,6
"No, we didn't. You passed out before we could.",3
Oh. That's a shame.,6
Is it? Do you really like me too or was it just the alcohol talking?,3
I don't know. Maybe both.,6
"Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?",4
"Uh, sure. What is it?",6
"Well, there's something I've been meaning to tell you for a long time.",4
What is it?,6
I really like you. A lot.,4
You do?,6
"Yes, I do. You're smart, funny, kind, beautiful... You're everything I ever wanted.",4
Wow. I don't know what to say.,6
You don't have to say anything. Just listen.,4
Okay.,6
I've liked you since the first day I saw you in math class. You were sitting next to me and you smiled at me. I felt something in my heart that I never felt before.,4
Really?,6
"Yes, really. And ever since then, I've been trying to get closer to you. To be your friend, to make you laugh, to make you happy.",4
You have. You're a great friend.,6
But I want to be more than friends. I want to be your boyfriend.,4
My boyfriend?,6
"Yes, your boyfriend. Will you go out with me?",4
I... I don't know.,3
Why not? Don't you like me back?,4
I do. I do like you back. A lot.,3
Then what's the problem?,4
I'm just... scared.,3
Scared of what?,4
Scared of losing you. Scared of getting hurt. Scared of not being good enough for you.,3
"Hey, hey, don't say that. You're not going to lose me. I'm not going to hurt you. And you're more than good enough for me. You're perfect for me.",4
Really?,3
"Yes, really. Trust me. I love you.",4
You love me?,3
"Yes, I love you. With all my heart.",4
I love you too.,5
"Hey, where are you? I'm waiting for you at the park.",5
"Sorry, I can't make it.",4
What? Why not?,6
I have to study for a test.,4
A test? What test?,6
A math test. It's tomorrow.,4
But we planned this date a week ago. You said you were free today.,6
"I know, I know. But I forgot about the test. It's really important.",4
More important than me?,6
"No, of course not. But I can't fail this test. It's worth 50% of my grade.",4
So what? You're smart. You'll do fine.,6
"No, I won't. I'm terrible at math. I need to study.",4
Fine. Study then. See if I care.,2
Don't be like that. Please understand.,4
Understand what? That you don't care about me? That you don't want to spend time with me?,2
"No, that's not true. I do care about you. I do want to spend time with you.",4
Then prove it. Come to the park. Now.,2
I can't. I'm sorry.,4
Fine. Then we're done. Don't ever talk to me again.,2
"What? No, please. Don't say that.",5
"I'm sorry, who is this?",7
"What do you mean? It's me, your girlfriend.",5
"Oh, right. Sorry, I forgot your name.",7
How can you forget my name? We've been dating for two months.,5
"Have we? Wow, time flies.",7
Are you kidding me? Are you playing some kind of sick joke on me?,6
"No, I'm not kidding. I'm not playing any jokes. I'm just being honest.",7
Honest? Honest about what?,6
Honest about the fact that I don't love you. That I never loved you. That I only dated you because I felt sorry for you.,7
What? How can you say that?,5
"Because it's the truth. You're boring, annoying, clingy, and ugly. I don't know what I saw in you.",7
That's not true. You're lying. You're just trying to hurt me.,5
"No, I'm not lying. I'm telling you the truth. You deserve to know.",7
"No, I don't. I don't deserve this. I don't deserve you.",5
You're right. You don't deserve me. You deserve someone worse than me. Someone who will make you miserable.,7
Why are you being so cruel? What did I ever do to you?,5
Nothing. You did nothing to me. That's the problem. You're so dull and passive. You never do anything interesting or exciting.,7
That's not true. I do things. I do things with you.,5
Like what? Going to the movies? Going to the park? Going to the library? Those are not things. Those are boring activities.,7
They're not boring. They're fun. They're romantic.,5
"Romantic? Ha! There's nothing romantic about you. You're so shy and timid. You never kiss me, you never hug me, you never touch me.",7
"That's not true. I do kiss you, I do hug you, I do touch you.",5
"Yeah, but only when I ask you to. And even then, you're so awkward and clumsy. You don't know how to please me.",7
That's not true. I do know how to please you. I do please you.,5
"No, you don't. You're terrible in bed. You're the worst lover I ever had.",7
"Hey, are you okay? I heard what happened.",8
"No, I'm not okay. He broke up with me. He cheated on me. He lied to me.",5
"Oh, I'm so sorry. He's such a jerk. You deserve better.",8
Thank you. You're very kind.,3
"No, you're very kind. You're very smart, funny, kind, beautiful... You're everything he ever wanted.",8
"No, I'm not. He said I'm boring, annoying, clingy, and ugly. He said I'm the worst lover he ever had.",5
He's lying. He's just saying that to hurt you. He's jealous of you. He's insecure about himself.,8
Really? You think so?,6
"Yes, I do. Trust me. I know him. He's a bad person. He doesn't deserve you.",8
Thank you. You're a good person. You deserve happiness.,3
Thank you. You're a good person too. You deserve happiness too.,8
Thank you. But I don't think I'll ever be happy again.,5
Don't say that. You will be happy again. You have so much to live for.,8
Like what? What do I have to live for?,6
"Like your friends, your family, your dreams, your hobbies...",8
But I don't have any friends. He was my only friend.,5
"That's not true. You have many friends. You have me, for example.",8
You? You're my friend?,6
Of course I'm your friend. I've always been your friend. I've always liked you.,8
You have? You do?,6
"Yes, I have. Yes, I do. You're smart, funny, kind, beautiful... You're everything I ever wanted.",8
Wow. I don't know what to say.,6
You don't have to say anything. Just listen.,8
Okay.,6
I've liked you since the first day I saw you in math class. You were sitting next to me and you smiled at me. I felt something in my heart that I never felt before.,8
Really?,6
"Yes, really. And ever since then, I've been trying to get closer to you. To be your friend, to make you laugh, to make you happy.",8
You have. You're a great friend.,6
And I want to be your best friend. I want to be there for you.,8
My best friend?,6
"Hey, I need to tell you something.",11
What is it?,6
"Well, you know how I've been dating Lisa for a while?",11
"Yeah, what about her?",6
"Well, I kind of cheated on her.",11
What? You did? With who?,6
With... with you.,11
With me? What do you mean?,6
I mean that night we got drunk and hooked up. Remember?,11
Oh. Oh no. I don't remember that.,6
"Well, it happened. And I feel terrible about it.",11
You should. How could you do that to Lisa? She's your girlfriend. She loves you.,9
"I know, I know. I love her too. It was a mistake. A stupid mistake.",11
A mistake? A mistake is forgetting to buy milk. Not sleeping with your best friend's sister.,9
"Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. It's not your fault. It's mine.",11
"No, it's not just your fault. It's mine too. I should have stopped you.",11
But you didn't. You wanted it too.,11
"No, I didn't. I was drunk. I didn't know what I was doing.",11
Me too. I was drunk too. I didn't mean to hurt Lisa.,11
But you did. You hurt her. And you hurt me.,11
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. What can I do to make it up to you?,11
Nothing. There's nothing you can do. You can't undo what you did.,9
"Please, don't say that. There has to be a way to fix this.",11
There's no way to fix this. You broke our trust. You broke our friendship.,9
"Please, don't end our friendship. You're my best friend. You're like a brother to me.",11
A brother? A brother who sleeps with his sister? That's disgusting.,9
"I know, I know. It's disgusting. It's wrong. It's unforgivable.",11
Then why did you do it? Why did you betray me?,9
I don't know. I don't know why I did it. I guess I was jealous of you.,10
Jealous of me? Why were you jealous of me?,6
"Because you have everything. You have a great girlfriend, a great job, a great car, a great life.",10
That's not true. I don't have everything. I have problems too.,6
Like what? What problems do you have?,10
Like... like... I don't know. But I'm sure I have some.,6
See? You don't have any problems. You're perfect. You're always perfect.,10
"No, I'm not perfect. I'm not always perfect. I make mistakes too.",6
"Yeah, but not as big as mine. Not as bad as mine.",10
Maybe not. But that doesn't mean you can ruin my life.,9
I didn't mean to ruin your life. I just wanted to have a taste of it.,10
"Well, you had your taste. And you spit it out. And you left a bitter taste in my mouth.",9
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Please, forgive me.",11
I don't know if I can. I don't know if I should.,9
"Please, try. Please, give me another chance.",11
